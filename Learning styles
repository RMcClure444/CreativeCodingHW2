I as well have had a "fixed mindset" on certain things in my life. Ive had trouble accepting my weaknesses. like others have spoken about i grew up with the struggle of math. It started when i was in the third grade struggling with my long division worksheet. While all my friends were were done and playing together in the classroom i was still sitting at my desk struggling. since then up until i graduatd high school i had to be in a seperate classroom from my classmates and learn math with extra help. Through those years i came to understand i wasn't the only oe struggling. The classes were always small around 5 to 6 people, but we all were trying to learn together.  But yes i think everyone can change their mindsets if they are in the right space to do so, its definitely good to have set goals for yourself to have a happy and healthier mindset:)
